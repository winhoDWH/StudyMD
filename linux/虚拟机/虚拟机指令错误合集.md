### 虚拟机ping百度网站失败
1. ping百度（www.baidu.com）并且yum下载失败；yum会报一下错误
```
Could not retrieve mirrorlist http://mirrorlist.centos.org/?release=7&arch=x86_64&repo=os&infra=stock32 error was
14: curl#6 - "Could not resolve host: mirrorlist.centos.org; Unknown error"

One of the configured repositories failed (Unknown),
and yum doesn't have enough cached data to continue. At this point the only
safe thing yum can do is fail. There are a few ways to work "fix" this:

 1. Contact the upstream for the repository and get them to fix the problem.

 2. Reconfigure the baseurl/etc. for the repository, to point to a working
    upstream. This is most often useful if you are using a newer
    distribution release than is supported by the repository (and the
    packages for the previous distribution release still work).

 3. Disable the repository, so yum won't use it by default. Yum will then
    just ignore the repository until you permanently enable it again or use
    --enablerepo for temporary usage:

        yum-config-manager --disable <repoid>

 4. Configure the failing repository to be skipped, if it is unavailable.
    Note that yum will try to contact the repo. when it runs most commands,
    so will have to try and fail each time (and thus. yum will be be much
    slower). If it is a very temporary problem though, this is often a nice
    compromise:

        yum-config-manager --save --setopt=<repoid>.skip_if_unavailable=true
```
2. 解决方法：用VI编辑resolv.conf文件 命令 vi /etc/resolv.conf 添加： nameserver 114.114.114.114，然后重启虚拟机；
3. **网上说是没有配置DNS服务器**；

### 执行yum install xxx失败
1. 报错信息：Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, langpacks No such command: intsall. Please use /usr/bin/yum --help
2. 解决方法：修改yum配置文件
```
vi /etc/yum.conf
将plugins=1改为plugins=0
```

### tar报错：tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now
解决方法：将解压参数中的z去掉，即：tar -xvf xxxx.tar.gz
